 Hello Guys/Gals!

My name is S Sandeep Pillai, I'm a first year CS branch student.
I aspire to become a good programmer one day, and coding is my passion.
I am an avid gamer and also really like reading books. A typical nerd if you've seen one.

Thank you FOSSMEC, I've finally figured out how to use the nano editor, Its really fun :-)

Cheers,
    Carbon-
