#Introduction

Heyy! My name is **Aiswarya Jayachandran** and I'am from **CS1A** . I was introduced to coding in my 11th grade and I've been loving it ever since. I did 
my schooling from Bhavans Vidhya Mandir Elamakkara and I'm super exicted to start college at MEC.

#My interests
* Prgramming
* Science in general

#Why FOSSMEC
I would like to join **FOSSMEC** because I believe it can help in improving myself in programming.
