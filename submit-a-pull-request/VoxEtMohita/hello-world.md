# Hi! #

I’m Mohita Liza Bipin of EC1A 


## A little about me ##

I wasn’t really into coding until this summer when I discovered a site called [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and once I started I just couldn’t stop.

**Here’s a useless fact:** The number 42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.

**Another useless fact:** In case you hadn’t noticed my favourite number is 42.


## Why I want to join FOSSMEC ##

I would love to make my contribution to the OSS community by using my knowledge and applying it somewhere that’s useful.~~I really need to stop wasting time watching anime and reading obscure books no ones heard of~~. Also I hope to make some friends and have a great time along the way.
