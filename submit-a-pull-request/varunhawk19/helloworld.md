I am just a **noob** in the field of programming but I just ***love it***.In programming i like solving algorithmic challenges. I have worked on implementing few machine learning algorithms, creating simple websites, pseudo random number genaration.....

The technologies i have some knowledge about are 
1. CPP - My favourite and go to go language, also the one in which i am the most proficient as well as incompetant in.
2. Python - Barely. Used it mostly for machine learning purposes.
3. C - Did really basic stuff like a sudoku solver. But i guess its the only language whose syntax i know the most.
4. Some common web devolpment technologies - HTML/CSS/js/bootstrap....

## ~~In~~complete projects
1. [Using genetic algorithm and hashing to create higly random numbers with minimal collision](https://github.com/varunhawk19/genetic_algorithm)
2. [Naive attempt on steganography](https://github.com/varunhawk19/bitmap)
3. Tweet anlyser using the twittter api.
4. Sudoku solver,tic tac toe solver, 2 player chess.

## Why i would like to be a part of FOSS?

I have always been very interested in opensource technologies as well as enthusiastic about contributing to them. But never knew how to do it. I aspire to be a GSOC'er in the upcoming years and it always has been my dream to contribute to the linux kernal in the future.
