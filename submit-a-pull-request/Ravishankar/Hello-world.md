Hey I'm Ravi from CS A 

I don't know a lot about coding. Just a few things from C++ I picked up 
from school.But I have to say, trying out Git-Hub was fun and i would 
definately like to learn more about it.

I'm more of a sportsman so I'm kinda surprised that coding has seemed to 
be interesting to me.The tutorial were extremely helpfull so kudos to 
the FOSSMEC team and I'm really look forward to working with you guys. 
:)
