Hey! I'm Ravi from CS-A

I'm really quite surprised that I've found coding interesting especially 
since I'm more of an outdoor person.

I only know a few basic programmes that i learned in !2th (C++).
But I found GitHub really fun and the tuturial was easily 
understandable, so kudos to the FossMec team for putting a good amount 
of work inorder to help us be better developers :)

I look forward to working with you guys and maybe we can talk about 
who's gonna win the Premier League? :p

Cheers!
